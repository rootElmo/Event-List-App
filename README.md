# Event-List-App

### About

This is a small React Native application made for a school project. The user is able to vreate new events, edit already added events, searching events, and deleting them. The events are stored in a SQLite database locally to the user's phone.

## To-do

- Clean-up
..* Create separate stylesheets, they're now in the components' code
..* Comment code
..* Implement a smarter way to set location to an event (a map with coordinates?)
..* Fix issue with events list not updating after adding event
